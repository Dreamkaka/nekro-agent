## 🚀 Core Capabilities

NekroAgent uses a powerful and flexible prompt construction system to guide the AI in generating accurate code, which is then executed in a sandbox environment, interacting with the real world via RPC communication. Key features include:

**Core Execution & Extensibility:**

- **Code Generation & Secure Sandbox**: Guides AI to generate code and execute it in a secure, containerized environment, forming a solid foundation for complex tasks and method-level extensibility.
- **Highly Extensible Plugin System**: Provides various key node callbacks, prompt injections, and custom sandbox methods, creating an ultra-intelligent hub for solutions ranging from small tools to large-scale system integrations.
- **Native Multi-person Interaction**: Efficiently understands group chat dynamics and maintains interaction capabilities in complex multi-person conversations.
- **Ultimate Cost & Efficiency Optimization**: Rejects ineffective prompts and abusive iterative agents, focusing on the logical root of problem-solving.
- **Automatic Error Correction & Feedback**: Deeply cultivates prompt error correction and feedback mechanisms, breaking the cycle of errors and repetition.

**Connectivity & Interaction:**

- **Multi-platform Adapter Architecture**: Natively supports various chat platforms like `OneBot v11`, `Discord`, `Minecraft`, and `Bilibili Live`, providing a unified development interface.
- **Native Multimodal Vision Understanding**: Can process various resources like images and files for multimodal interaction with users.
- **Event-driven Asynchronous Architecture**: Follows an async-first principle for efficient responsiveness.

**Ecosystem & Usability:**

- **Cloud Resource Sharing**: Includes plugins, personas, and more, driven by a strong and friendly community.
- **Full-featured Visual Interface**: Offers a powerful application management and monitoring dashboard.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The core of Nekro Agent is designed around **input/output streams**. Adapters act as bridges to external platforms, only needing to implement message reception (input stream) and sending (output stream) for a specific platform. All complex business logic, such as session management, plugin execution, and sandbox calls, is automatically handled by the Nekro Agent core engine. This design ensures high extensibility and maintainability, allowing developers to focus on the adapter's functionality without worrying about the complex core implementation.

    end
